# Docker Setup Notes
## After Cloning the Repo
- Run `composer install --ignore-platform-reqs` to get all the dependencies in place
- Run `docker ps` to see current services and ports to avoid
- Run `bin/cake EditYaml [options]`
    - Provide a short project name (2-3 letters) `-d {database port} -w {web port}`
    - The short project name, database port, and web port keep this particular docker container from stepping on other docker containers
- Run `docker compose up --build -d`
### If you want to verify the db testing environment
- Run `bin/migrations.sh`
### Php Interpretor setup in PhpStorm

# CakePHP Application Skeleton

[![PHPStan](https://img.shields.io/badge/PHPStan-level%207-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan)

A skeleton for creating applications with [CakePHP](https://cakephp.org) 5.x.

The framework source code can be found here: [cakephp/cakephp](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp).

## Installation

1. Download [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md) or update `composer self-update`.
2. Run `php composer.phar create-project --prefer-dist cakephp/app [app_name]`.

If Composer is installed globally, run

```bash
composer create-project --prefer-dist cakephp/app
```

In case you want to use a custom app dir name (e.g. `/myapp/`):

```bash
composer create-project --prefer-dist cakephp/app myapp
```

You can now either use your machine's webserver to view the default home page, or start
up the built-in webserver with:

```bash
bin/cake server -p 8765
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8765` to see the welcome page.

## Update

Since this skeleton is a starting point for your application and various files
would have been modified as per your needs, there isn't a way to provide
automated upgrades, so you have to do any updates manually.

## Configuration

Read and edit the environment specific `config/app_local.php` and set up the
`'Datasources'` and any other configuration relevant for your application.
Other environment agnostic settings can be changed in `config/app.php`.

## Layout

The app skeleton uses [Milligram](https://milligram.io/) (v1.3) minimalist CSS
framework by default. You can, however, replace it with any other library or
custom styles.
